A survey of performance for various supervised and unsupervised learning techniques in predicting genre from 71 Fourier Transform derived audio features.

We implement the following approaches in R:
Principal Component Analysis, Hierarchical Clustering, Linear Discriminant Analysis, Random Forest, and Boosting.

Random Forest is the superior method for this dataset, predicting genre correctly just above 50% of the time.

Detailed report on these analyses is presented in the output .html file, as well as the .rmd (R Markdown Notebook) file which contains the full R code for replication.
