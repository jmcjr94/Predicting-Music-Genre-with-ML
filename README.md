# Predicting Music Genre with ML

A survey of performance for various supervised and unsupervised learning techniques in predicting genre from 71 Fourier Transform derived audio features.

We implement the following approaches in R:
Principal Component Analysis
Hierarchical Clustering
Linear Discriminant Analysis
Random Forest
Boosting

Random Forest is the superior method for this dataset, predicting genre correctly just above 50% of the time.

Detailed report on these analyses are presented in the output .html file, as well as the .rmd (R Markdown Notebook) file which contains the full R code for replication.
